## Project Description 

This venture shows you the zones which need trees to be planted and urges individuals to plant there. Each tree planted will be associated with a person's ID which they can share via web-based media once planted to get the message out about our foundation and make such a gradually expanding influence. Moreover, when the individual has planted the tree, he/she would have the option to the name the tree after him/her and get eco perceived. We would likewise Implement blockchain so a client's personality can't be changed and their eco impression will remain until the end of time. We accept through our application, individuals won't just fix the terrible contamination rates through planting, however will likewise turn out to be more natural amicable, needing to ensure the earth. <br>

But integrating the green view index information with the satellite information, we can perceive which zones may should be greener, and we will urge the closest individuals to plant on those territories. Additionally, satellite information can be utilized in numerous different models like to discover copied backwoods territories, zones where the waterways have dried. A forecast model can likewise be utilized on picture preparing to foresee the water bodies like streams which are going to dry in next barely any years. Along these lines, we can urge individuals to plant an ever-increasing number of trees on those areas to spare those water bodies.
<br>

Additionally for a further developed element we can give a time-frame to an individual like 14 days and we can say - your plantation is under audit period; keeping in mind that he/she is planting. The individual can label his/her scope and longitude of that place, and after certain sum measure of time when the real-time information update, we can have a check with some model that identifies planting video/photo uploaded by the user - and as we recognize this, we can give them their digital id.

## Model Description

This is a fake venture to just give you all an overview of what our project is. In the beginning the home page is displayed which contains maps on nav bar to navigate around the map that displays the places that are available and not available for planting by calculating their gvi. The green dots represents that the area has a decent gvi and the red dots represent the area has a low gvi value and could be available for planting. Next comes the login portal. Once signed in, the sign in portal redirects you to the user dashboard which shows up the number of trees planted by you, places marked by you that can be readily available for planting by others, your number of friends on envirogram and your world ranking based on the quantity of trees you planted or the scores. Further on the route bar of the client dashboard it also contains the latest posts section which displays the latest posts posted by the envirogram users updating their status of their trees. The Submit section redirects you to a page where you can upload videos/photos of yourself planting the tree so that the team actually knows you've planted a tree. Also, the leaerboard shows your ranking status among locals. We would have extra highlights executed soon. So till that, stay tuned!
